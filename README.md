# server
The (optional) ESP based MQTT server, for 'multiplayer' like line-by-line show running

## What is it
- The server is running an custom, built from scratch version of MQTT to be optimised for ESPs

## The jankyness
- It's a bit slow - hopefully we can make it faster.
- No testing for reliability
- Max 10 clients, 8 connetions each
